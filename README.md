# Comp472---Project-2

Question 1 (JAVA):

a) How many hidden layers have you used?

  None. This is a simple function, two input nodes to one output node.

b) Weight of each input node is set to 1, as they are both equally important. Bias is set to -1 to insure that the function returns 0 if only one of the inputs is equal to 1.
